# Pixel Piccaso
A project using javascript to learn more about the HTML 5 canvas tag. 

## Using this program
Just download into a zip, or clone, then open the index.html in a browser. 

## Tools
This is a dynamic paint program. There is some different tools.

* Draw tool
This tool shoots pixels out in all directions from the position of the mouse. It can either be random colours or a set color. This toggled by the down arrow. Also the spread of the pixels from the mouse can be controlled by the left and right arrow keys.

* Node tool
This tool creates a single point on the canvas that spawns pixels in all directions. The colour can be changed or edited

* Link tool
This creates 2 nodes, where one links to the other. To use this tool click once then another time and a menu will pop up. The second node will be turned off. And the pixels will flow from the first node to the second. The spread can be controlled. 

* Flow tool
The flow tool continually makes nodes and links as long as the mouse is held down and moved around.

## Notes

Take note of the edit menu on the bottom right, it can be used to edit any node after selecting a node from the node list.

Feel free to play around, there is a lot of cool things that can be made! 

Also note, if the linked(ID) property of a node is "receiver" that means it will not spawn any pixel blocks.
